    <div class="lore">Set in Detroit during the year 2038, the city has been revitalized by the invention and introduction of androids into everyday life.
      But when androids start behaving as if they are alive, events begin to spin out of control. 
      Step into the roles of the storyâ€™s pivotal three playable characters (Kara, Connor, and Markus),
      each with unique perspectives, motivations and abilities as they face their true selves and question their values. 
      These three androids are present throughout the game as they follow through an emotional journey with choices that must be taken in order for their ultimate 'cause',
      which can be defined many different ways depending on the values of the player.
     The plot of the game deals with a variety of mature themes that explore moral ground and each player decision affects what will happen.<p> </p></div>
